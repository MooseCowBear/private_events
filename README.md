# Private Events - Rails app

This is a solution to the Private Events project from the Odin Project's Rails path. 

## Features

User authentication via the Devise Gem. 

Displays events of two types: public and private. Public events are visible on the home page for anyone to view. Private events appear only on the pages of the creator and invitees. Any registered user may choose to add themselves to the guestlist of any public event. The creator of a private event determines the guestlist. Invited guests may accept or decline invitations to private events. 

Scopes are used to separate events into upcoming and past.
